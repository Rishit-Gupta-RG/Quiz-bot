example: !b mahatma gandhi
qm-panel channel sees "<team>'s <sender's name> : mahatma gandhi"
every team channel sees "Guess on the bounce by <team>'s <sender's name> : mahatma gandhi"

- !scores or !pointstable
example: !scores
sender's channel sees "<team> <score> <all members with the role as the team>" one team per line

- !s or !plus
example: !s -5 t2 t4 t6
-5 added to score of team2, team4, team6
scores-channel sees "<points> to <list of teams>. Points table now: <pointstable>"
channels of teams with update see "<points> to your team. Your score is now <total points>"
action only when sender has role quizmaster, scorer

- !resetScores

all scores set to 0 and file updated
channel sender sees "scores reset"
