example: !newQuiz 7
sets number of teams, clears channels, creates new scores.txt file, sends welcome messages

- !endQuiz or !stopQuiz

pounces-guesses channel sees "mahatma gandhi pounced by <teams>'s <sender's name>"
sender's channel gets the message "Pounce submitted"

- !b or !bounce
example: !b mahatma gandhi
bounces-guesses channel sees "<team>'s <sender's name> : mahatma gandhi"
every team channel sees "Guess on the bounce by <team>'s <sender's name> : mahatma gandhi"

- !scores or !pointstable
example: !scores
sender's channel sees "<team> <score> <all members with the role as the team>" one team per line

- !s or !plus
example: !s -5 t2 t4 t6
-5 added to score of team2, team4, team6
scores-channel sees "<points> to <list of teams>. Points table now: <pointstable>"
channels of teams with update see "<points> to your team. Your score is now <total points>"
action only when sender has role quizmaster, scorer

- !minus or !deduct
example: !minus 5 t2 t4 t6
5 subtracted from score of team2, team4, team6
scores-channel sees "<points> to <list of teams>. Points table now: <pointstable>"
channels of teams with update see "<points> off your team score. Your score is now <total points>"
action only when sender has role quizmaster, scorer

- !clearAllChannels
example: !clearAllChannels
all messages from all non-whitelisted channels deleted
all scores reset to 0
action only when sender has role quizmaster, scorer

- !clearThis
example !clearThis 
all messages in that caller's channel are deleted
action on channels bounce-guesses, pounce-guesses, scores  when sender has role quizmaster, scorer

- !resetRoles
example !resetRoles
all members of the guild with a role beginning with team are removed from the role
