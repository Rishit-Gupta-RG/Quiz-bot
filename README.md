# PounceScoreBounceBot

## What is it?

This is a discord bot to handle pounces and bounces in a quiz. A participant is assigned their team as a role (e.g. 'team1', 'team2') 
and has access only to the chat and voice channels of that team. They also have access to the general channels, but switching 
between channels is typically tiresome. This bot tries to make it easier for the participant by giving them no need to move out of 
their team's text chat channel. 


### Pouncing

To pounce, a participant simply types
!p their pounce answer
This message is displayed as a popup to the quizmaster and appears in a separate channel for pounce answers that only the
quizmaster has access to. For example, if a quizzer named harish in team3 wants to submit "mahatma gandhi" as a pounce answer,
he simply types `!p mahatma gandhi` in team3's channel. The quizmaster would see the message `mahatma gandhi pounced by team3's harish`.


### Bounce

Similarly, for bounce, a team types in their team's private chat 
`!b their bounce answer`
The bot sends this message to the private chats of all teams. So, if harish of team 3 were to answer mahatma gandhi" on bounce,
he would type `!b mahatma gandhi` and all teams would see `Guess on the bounce by team3's harish : mahatma gandhi`. This will also appear 
in a separate bounces channel. 


### Scoring

The 'quizmaster' or someone else who is assigned with the role of 'scorer' can simply type `!s 10 t4 t6` to add 10 points to the scores 
of team4 and team6. Likewise, `!s -15 t1 t8` subtracts 15 points from the scores of team1 and team8. All score updates will be visible on 
the dedicated scores channel and a message will be sent to every team that has an update. The score channel will also have the full table 
of points of every team after every update.

Typing !scores at any time from any channel will display all the scores. 

If there are connectivity issues, the bot may reload and the scores may reset to zero. A warning will be displayed and the scores will have 
to be entered again. Pounce/bounce should not be affected.  

### Cleanup

This command deletes all messages in all channels with IDs defined in the code:
`!clearAllChannels` 
This command deletes all messages in the specific channel it is called
`!clearThis`
